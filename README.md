# GridScorer

GridScorer takes in a linear array and turns into an n matrix; based on the input it will calculate the highest score from itself and the surrounding location.

## Setup

Make sure to have rustup installed - https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

You can use your IDE of your choice, but I will provide the setup for Visual Studio Code:

1) Install the "rust-analyzer" extension (this aids with development and the ability to build the project)
2) Install "CodeLLDB" this will help running tests locally
